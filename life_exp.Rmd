# Ex1

  Loads the gapminder_unfiltered data frame into R, and   
  Calculates the maximum life expectancy each year and the corresponding country that had that maximum life expectancy. Hint: There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest involves group_by() and filter().

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
data("gapminder-unfiltered")
head(gapminder_unfiltered)
```



```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  arrange(year)%>%
  filter(lifeExp==max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(year,country,lifeExp)->md
md
```

filter is better than summarise, one year have multiple country, when use summarise it will just show one maximum lifeExp


Now I will make a plot of this
